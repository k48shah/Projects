Unfortunately The code is all I have saved of the project. The unity project prefabs and scenes were deleted during a change of hardware. 

Think of the project like a collision avoidance system for a car, except the car learns to avoid obstacles by crashing for a given number of generations.

There needs to be a track, and a vehicle. 'Checkpoints' are invisible planes with triggers set up to find the "best fit" in a generation. 
(Yes there are genetic algorithms involved as well)
